            <h1>Communication In Computer Network</h1>
            <h2>Protocols</h2>
                <p>
                  Protocols are essential for successful transmission of data over a network. Each protocol defines a set of rules that must be agreed between sender and receiver. At the simplest level, a protocol could define that a positive voltage represents a bit with value 1. At the other extreme, a protocol could define the format of the first 40 bytes in a packet. The complexity of networking requires a very large number of protocols, a protocol suite is a collection of related protocols. TCP/IP is the dominant protocol suite for internet usage.
                </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>
                      <strong>Protocol:</strong>
                      A set of rules governing communication between computers.
                  </li>
                  <li>Ensures the computers that communicate understand each other.</li>
              </ul>
            <h2 id="IP">Internet Protocol (IP)</h2>
                <p>
                  The Internet Protocol (IP) is a network layer protocol that is responsible for delivering packets of data from a source to a destination over a network. It does this by routing the packets through intermediate devices such as routers, which use IP addresses to determine the best path for the packets to take.
                  An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing. IP addresses are written and displayed in human-readable notation, such as 192.168.1.1.
                  There are two versions of IP in use today: IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6). IPv4 is the most widely used version, but it is running out of available addresses due to the rapid growth of the internet. IPv6 was developed to address this issue and is now beginning to be adopted on a larger scale. It uses a 128-bit address space, which allows for significantly more addresses than IPv4's 32-bit address space.
                  In addition to routing packets, IP also provides a number of other services, including fragmentation and reassembly of packets, time-to-live (TTL) value to prevent infinite routing loops, and error checking using a checksum.</p>
                  <h2 id="TCP">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</h2>
                  <p>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a transport layer protocol that is responsible for establishing and maintaining a reliable connection between two devices and ensuring that data is delivered in the correct order. It does this by establishing a connection, breaking the data into segments, and sending each segment with a sequence number to the destination. The destination device then acknowledges receipt of each segment and sends the next segment in the sequence. If a segment is not acknowledged, TCP will retransmit it until it is received. This process ensures that data is delivered accurately and efficiently.
                  TCP is often used in combination with IP, forming the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite of protocols. TCP/IP is the basis for communication on the internet and is used by almost all devices connected to the internet, including computers, smartphones, and tablets.
              </p>

            <h2 id="MAC-address">MAC Address</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>A media access control address (MAC address)</strong> is a unique identifier assigned to every device connected
              on a network. This use is common in Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. MAC addresses are recognizable as
              six groups of two hexadecimal digit which is often displayed with a colon or hyphen, such as
              3F:59:11:22:M9:E3 or 3f-59-11-22-m9-e3.
            </p><br>

            <strong class="duy">Difference between MAC address and IP address:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Both MAC addresses and IP addresses are used to identify your device, but for different reasons:</li>
              <li>MAC addresses are unique to each device while IP addresses can be reassigned or transferred to
                different device.</li>
              <li>When a device with MAC address X may have an IP of 1.2.3.4. If the X device is removed from the
                network, that IP address will be transferred to another device with MAC address Y</li>
              <li>MAC addresses are used to transfer data within the same local network. You need an IP address if you
                want your data to transfer to other networks, such as the Internet.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="Circuit-and-packet-switching">Circuit And Packet Switching</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Circuit switching</strong> is a method of data transfer in which the message is sent over a dedicated 
              communication channel. The channel is in the physical form. An example of this is a Landline Phone.

              <h2 id="LAN">LAN</h2>
              <p>
                A LAN, or local area network, is a group of interconnected devices that communicate with each other 
and share resources within a small geographical area, such as a home, office, or school. There are 
several different types of LANs, each with its own unique features and benefits. 
              </p><br>

              <p>
                1. Ethernet LAN: Ethernet is the most common type of LAN, particularly in corporate and educational 
                environments. It uses a coaxial or twisted-pair cable to connect devices, such as computers, printers, 
                and servers, to a central hub or switch. Ethernet LANs can operate at speeds of 10, 100, or 1000 
                megabits per second (Mbps), depending on the technology used. They are reliable, fast, and easy to set 
                up, making them a popular choice for many businesses. 
              </p><br>

              <p>
                2. Wi-Fi LAN: A Wi-Fi LAN, also known as a wireless LAN, uses radio waves to transmit data between 
devices without the need for physical cables. It is ideal for devices that do not have a fixed location, such 
as laptops, smartphones, and tablets. Wi-Fi LANs can operate at speeds of up to 1 Gbps and have a 
range of several hundred feet, depending on the device and the environment. They are convenient and 
flexible, but may be less secure and have lower speeds than wired LANs. 
              </p><br>

              <p>
                3. Token Ring LAN: A Token Ring LAN is a type of LAN that uses a ring topology and a special type of data 
transmission called token passing. In this system, a token, or small data packet, is passed from¬¬¬¬ one 
device to another in a specific order. Each device can only transmit data when it has possession of the 
token. Token Ring LANs are less common than Ethernet LANs, but they offer higher speeds and better 
security.
              </p><br>

              <p>
                4. Fiber-Optic LAN: A fiber-optic LAN uses thin strands of glass or plastic to transmit data using light 
signals. It is a fast and reliable option for transmitting large amounts of data over long distances. 
However, it is more expensive and difficult to install than other types of LANs.
              </p><br>

              <p>
                5. Bluetooth LAN: A Bluetooth LAN is a wireless LAN that uses Bluetooth technology to connect devices 
within a short range (usually up to 30 feet). It is commonly used to connect devices such as headphones, 
speakers, and keyboards to a computer or phone. Bluetooth LANs are convenient and low-power, but 
have low speeds and a short range compared to other types of LANs.
              </p><br>

              <p>
                6. HomePNA LAN: A HomePNA LAN is a type of LAN that uses a phone line to connect devices within a 
home. It is an affordable and easy-to-use option for setting up a small home network. However, it has 
limited speeds and is not as widely supported as other types of LANs
              </p><br>

              <p>
                7. In conclusion, there are several different types of LANs, each with its own unique features and 
benefits. The type of LAN that is best for you will depend on your specific needs and requirements, such 
as the number of devices, the distance between them, the amount of data being transmitted, and the 
level of security and speed required. References:

              <h2 id="TLS">TLS</h2>
              <p>
                Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol that is used to secure communications over 
the internet. It is the successor to the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol and is widely used to secure 
data transmission on the internet, including email, web browsing, and voice over IP (VoIP). TLS works by 
establishing an encrypted connection between two devices, such as a client and a server. It does this by 
using a process called the TLS handshake, which involves the following steps: 
              </p><br>
                
              <p>
                1. The client sends a "hello" message to the server, which includes a list of supported cipher suites 
(algorithms for encrypting and decrypting data).
              </p><br>

              <p>
                2. The server responds with a "hello" message that includes a certificate containing the server's public 
key and a list of cipher suites that it supports.
              </p><br>

              <p>
                3. The client verifies the server's certificate and selects a cipher suite from the list of supported ones. 
              </p><br>

              <p>
                4. The client generates a pre-master secret, which is encrypted using the server's public key and sent to 
the server.

              </p><br>

              <p>
                5. The server decrypts the pre-master secret using its private key and generates a master secret, which 
is used to generate the session keys for encrypting and decrypting data.
              </p><br>

              <p>
                6. The client and server send messages to each other indicating that the handshake is complete and that 
they can start sending encrypted data. TLS is an important security feature that helps to protect against 
man-in-the-middle attacks, in which an attacker intercepts and tries to modify data being transmitted 
between two devices. It is also used to authenticate the identity of the server, which helps to prevent 
phishing attacks
              </p><br>

              <p>
                In summary, routers and TLS are two important technologies that play a crucial role in networking and 
internet security. Routers are responsible for forwarding data packets between networks, while TLS is a 
cryptographic protocol that is used to secure communications over the internet. Together, they help to 
ensure that data is delivered accurately and securely.
              </p><br>

              <h2 id="Router">Router</h2>
              <p>
                A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. It does this by 
using routing tables and protocols to determine the best path for the packets to take based on their 
destination. Routers are often used to connect different LANs or to connect a LAN to the internet. 
Routers operate at the network layer (layer 3) of the OSI model, which means they are responsible for 
routing packets based on their IP addresses. They use routing tables, which contain a list of destination 
IP addresses and the corresponding next hop (the router or other device that the packet should be 
forwarded to) to determine the best path for the packet. Routers also use protocols such as the Routing 
Information Protocol (RIP) and the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol to communicate with other
